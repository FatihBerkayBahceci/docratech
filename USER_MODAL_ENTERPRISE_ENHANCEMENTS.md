**Developer:** DocraTech Development Team  

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enterprise-level enhancements implemented for the "Create User" modal and related components to meet modern UX standards and DocraTech branding requirements.

## Enhanced Features Implemented

### 1. **Improved Confirmation Dialog for Unsaved Changes**

#### Previous Behavior:
- Basic blocking behavior without user choice

- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support and keyboard navigation

#### Key Improvements:
```vue
<!-- Enhanced confirmation with visual hierarchy -->
<div class="w-16 h-16 mx-auto mb-4 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-100 to-orange-100">
